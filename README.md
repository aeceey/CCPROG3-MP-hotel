Room Names are automated already. Even if a new room is added later on, it does not create a duplicate name of room.
addReservations gone, just add again later.

Slight issue with room names.

1. Create Hotel - Creates a Hotel with a name and number of rooms. Rooms are automatically named.
2. Remove Hotel- does not check the reservation system yet as it the system is non-existent.
3. View Hotel just prints out strins for now (error), just fix later.
4. Manage Hotel - changes hotel name, adds and removes room, views room name
